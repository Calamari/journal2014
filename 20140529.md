- 14:00 - I dont use a nginx in a container. But if I would, using `dockerfile/nginx` as base, looks better then my version.

- 15:35 - Starting a puma app is a bit tricky. At least if trying doing it via ([upstart](http://tommy.chheng.com/2013/01/23/deploying-a-rails-app-on-nginxpuma-with-capistrano/)). But I think using the capistrano3-puma gem, it should work without sudo.

- 18:25 - Deployment kinda works. Assets are not minified. The settings are missing. And  the deployment sometimes fails due to not being able to find unix socket. WTF?

- 18:45 - With current setup it is hard, to *only* have minifed assets for staging/production and unminifed for development.

- 19:10 - Damn vendor packages produce errors when minified... But unminified is not an option (damn 1.5 MB).
