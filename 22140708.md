- 15:45 - Caching of Serializers can be relatively easy done like [described by Thoughtbot](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/fast-json-apis-in-rails-with-key-based-caches-and).

    But it should be mentioned, that it will, of course, also cache the associations. But merging in the assoications as own (partial) serializer the same way seems to work fine. Now I'm curious if it will really speed up the 4 second controller action.


## ToDo

- Read about generators and really try them out, do they make code really better like [TJ Holowaychuk says](https://medium.com/code-adventures/4ba9e7f3e52b)?
