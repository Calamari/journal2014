**mindmatters**

- 9:40 - I learned that the `Function` class can be used to create functions (as done in SlickGrid aggregators), but those will lose all scope and only know the variables given as arguments and be created in window scope.

- 15:00 - Docker macht immer zu nur Probleme.

    Regarding to Ole, Docker seems to be running best on BtrFS. Also Facebook uses it?

- 15:10 - Why the heck does the generating of javascript files via gulp **7 seconds**? Waaahhh!!

- 17:20 - Just read a nice [article how to write gems that work on MRI Ruby, JRuby, Opal and RubyMotion](http://blog.crossplatformruby.com/universal-ruby-gems-in-20-lines-of-code/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email)

- 17:35 - To always create postgresql database and without test unit tests on new rails projects, [We can use an .railsrc file](http://railscasts.com/episodes/318-upgrading-to-rails-3-2). That's neat. `.railsrc` could look like that:

    ```
      -d postgresql -T
    ```

    Also allowing to store hashes in ActiveRecord is cool.
