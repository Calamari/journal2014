- 12:20 - For building a asynchronous rack middleware, you have to `throw :async` and do `env['async.callback'].call(@app.call(env))` in an Eventmachine `defer` statement (to not block).

    See [bottom of this post](http://whereisjoel.tumblr.com/post/49635704638/asynchronous-io-in-rack-middleware).

    The rack middleware that handles serving of static assets in rails is called `ActionDispatch::Static`.

- 14:05 - Creating a file as long as a asset is right now being build, seems to work quite well. A rack middleware can delay the request until the asset has been rebuild.

- 18:25 - `Math.min.apply(null, array);` <- Thats a cool way to min an array
