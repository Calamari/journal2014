- 12:20 - Again had the problem, that boolean values will come from frontend as strings ("0" or "1"), which both are true if doing `if value`. There are two possibilities. First assign it to your instance, so ActiveRecord will take care of converting it, or use it's converting method `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Column.value_to_boolean(value)` to convert the value to boolean.
