**dancesocially**

- 10:15 - This question now is in my mind: How to really write out the time of event in right timezone within angular.

    Could use moment-timezone, but with all the Date is will get really hugh. There must be a simple way.

    There is a [good lib](https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect) that returns the current timezone of browser. (For modern datetimes only.)

    There is also a [timezone database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones)

- 10:35 - I think I will just do it with Rails API will return `startsAt` and a timezoned `startsAtInTimezone`. So I dont have to load additional stuff on client.

- 11:00 - Aaah, I think the problem is, that DateTimes are not saved as `TimeWithZone` objects. So they will be saved as UTC dates. Changing the loading syntax of that dates should fix that:

    ```ruby
    def starts_at
      attributes['starts_at'].in_time_zone(attributes['timezone']) if attributes['starts_at'].present?
    end
    ```

    With this I don't need any `startsAtInTimezone` logic.
