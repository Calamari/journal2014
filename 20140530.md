- 11:30 - We now have two versions of js and css. One minified and ony not. The minified is only loaded if `Settings.assets.minified` is `true`. That's because of gulp-minify-css can't process the source maps.

    And I figure, that having the assets in git is a bad idea, because it is so verbose. Maybe I should change that to a local build and just copy them over. This would also help in having a one click release-deploy process.

    Also shorter paths would be nice for assets. Maybe `a/js/app.js` or something.

 - 22:50 - node-sass can't import css files. It will not break, but it just ignores it. So I have to rename the bowered css to scss first before using it. :-/
