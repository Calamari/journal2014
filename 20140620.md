**dancesocially**

- 19:30 - Tried the whole day to get useful icons or colored markes in the map. The whole day!

    I have to clean up there, because of some twice and thrice calling if watching for the wrong events.

    And hey. The `leaflet-angular-directive` has hardcoded iconData types, like `awesomeMarker` for the `leaflet.awesome-marker`-Plugin. WTF?
