**mindmatters**

- 9:45 - Where are those opening ratio values? They are not defined, we have introduced them.

- 11:45 - In the side discussions here, *Getting Real* was mentioned as good book for solving problems. I guess I have to read it again. Can't remember much of it anymore.

- 14:20 - Pairing time. Much to clean upâ€¦

- 23:59 - Still can't figure out why docker is not installing neither via apt-get on ubuntu nor through the ansible role [mentioned here](http://www.ansible.com/blog/2014/02/12/installing-and-building-docker-with-ansible) (which does start, but does not print anything else).
