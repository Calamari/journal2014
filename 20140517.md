**home**

- 11:30 - Beside building a private registry-server where every host has to be pull from, I could try using `docker save` and `docker load` to copy images as tar archive to every server.

- 13:00 - I made the logs available through a docker volume. So error messages can be looked at somehow.

- 22:20 - Dockers `--volume-from` allows to create a container, where all volumes declared in the container mentioned in the volume-from-term are available. So they do not have to be bound and can still be accessed.

    Example:

    ```bash
    docker run -i -t --volumes-from dsdb --rm ubuntu /bin/bash
    ```

- 23:00 - Found [fig](http://orchardup.github.io/fig/). It's like foreman, just for starting all containers you need for development.

- 23:20 - [Shipyard](https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard) is used by dotCloud itself to offer PaaS. So I will give it a try and check out, if I can use it to deploy dancesocially with it. It's better as creating an own deploy pipeline anyway. And it provides basic monitoring.
