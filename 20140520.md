- 12:30 - Just figured before lunch, that I could look at all the parameters gulp-ruby-sass will accept, and I found that it has a loadPath parameter, which adds paths to the load path and reduces the verbosity of bower component imports in sass. But it's only ruby-sass, not node-sass. :(

- 14:00 - Gulp does not log correct times into console. They only say the time they need to start it, not to run it.

- 15:20 - Interesting. The gulp-ruby-sass needs 6 seconds to compile (4,5 seconds with filled cache) to compile the css file and using node-sass it's only 300 ms.

    The sass-convert is able to convert all of the sass files to scss in a really fast manner, but it needs time to start up. 800ms at least. So converting changed files on the fly is not praticable.

- 18:25 - I will just use capistrano 2 like in `penpaper` app to deploy app for now.

- 23:50 - Deployment with Capistrano 3 and gitlab.com seems to work, although Ubuntu-Server makes some problems.
