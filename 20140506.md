# 6.5.2014

**mindmatters**

- 13:45 - Read about [work journal on coderwall](https://coderwall.com/p/nudgba) and started this one
- 13:50 - Back to problem with model.js (RequireJS does not return the right object anymore for Backbone.AssociatedModel)
- 14:00 - Now creatives tests are broken again

    Interesting. Backbone.Marionette does have a concept of [Behaviors](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.behavior.md) since version 1.7.0

    This looks cool, but I guess it will be only useful, if you render everything with Backbone.
- 14:15 - Kleiner Exkurs, wie man irgendwelche Commands per shortcut in Sublime aufruft:

    Im package `Default.sublime-commands` öffnen, und diese command-Bezeichnungen nehmen

- 15:55 - Update of jquery from 1.9.1 to 1.11.1 changed behavior of .val on select

    In 1.9: $('select').val('') chooses the first options form select

    In 1.11: $('select').val('') sets value hard to '' although no option with empty value is present
- 16:30 - Commit and push of big update orgie

    And mtime problem within sprockets occured...

    *What is the component.json and the bower.json in bower packages for?*


**home**

- 20:00 - learned that bower.json was formerly known as component.json and seems to be forgotten to update by several packages so they break sprockets "I read everyone of them and try load all js files mentioned"-attitude for files that are not in file system but still mentioned in component.json.

- 21:00 - Reinstall a newer version of boot2docker via brew. Now using docker 0.10 (instead of 0.8). Have to rebuild all packages now.

    ```bash
    boot2docker stop
    boot2docker download
    boot2docker delete
    boot2docker install
    ```

- 21:45 - A comment on [my issue on chai about component.json](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/262#issuecomment-42349030) figues, that component.json is now used by [component.io](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/component.io). Which makes it a sprockets problem somehow.

- 22:00 - Still it is not possible to reach the exposed ports of docker containers, using…

    ```bash
    docker run -i --rm -p 127.0.0.1:3333:3000 dancesocially
    ```
