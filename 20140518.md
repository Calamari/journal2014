- 17:15 - Shipyard needs a registry to pull the images from. Uploading is not contained yat. Now creating an own registry to push to.

- 18:20 - I don't get the registry to work. But this way does not work. To push the application to the server just takes to much time with 500 MB. Maybe it's best to pack up every dependency into their own docker container (LB, DB, Redis,â€¦) and leave the App with normal deployment.
