- 10:00 - Discussed, that we will use scss for stylesheets and I just try out to browserify.

- 16:00 - Finished manually refactoring all 150 coffee script files. 2,5 hours. But I didn't tested it though.

    Using npm package `browserify-handlebars` to inline all text files. The json files just include easily.

- 16:45 - Ok, `browserify-handlebars` is really writing a wrapper for handlebars and does not only include the contents of the hbs file. So it's not compatible with [milk](https://github.com/pvande/Milk).

- 17:40 - Ok, now I just use `stringify` transformation that only does that.

    ``javascript
    gulp
      .src(paths.src.scripts + '/main.coffee', { read: false })
      .pipe(browserify({
        debug: true,
        transform: ['coffeeify', stringify(['.hbs'])],
        extensions: ['.coffee']
      }))
      .pipe(rename('main.js'))
      .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.dest.scripts));
    ```

- 18:00 - Go on with capistrano deployment

- 22:00 - Capistrano 3 will take care of symlinks on it's own, [i read in a blog post](https://semaphoreapp.com/blog/2013/11/26/capistrano-3-upgrade-guide.html). Great feature. It just symlinks all the things from release dir to respective links in shared dir.
