- 13:00 - There are two ways to use create a simple search filter for a `ng-repeat` list. One is to use angular`s `filter` filter and add a scope method that returns `true` or `false` for every item it gets, or the other is writing an own filter that gets the whole array and only returns the filtered subset of it.

    I think I go for the slightly simpler version and use the `filter` filter in my events admin.
