- 9:25 - How to update a node.js package? Simple install the `n` npm package and call `n stable`.

- 9:30 - `.calendar {table-layout:fixed;}` to get equal witdh cells in table. [from David Walsh](http://davidwalsh.name/tweet-code-3)

- 15:30 - Wrote a lot of tests for the slickgrid grouping feature. Nothing special.

- 21:50 - Using `ActiveSupport::TimeZone` looks promising to use for storing date times. But how to decide which zone to use?

    Using long/lat seems [slow, error prone or expensive](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41504/timezone-lookup-from-latitude-longitude), so I just use `ActiveSupport::TimeZone::MAPPING` in a select input to explicitely choose the timezone of the event. The last chosen one can be stored in session to preselect next time.

    But maybe [the timezone gem](https://github.com/panthomakos/timezone) is a possibility I have to investigate tomorrow.
