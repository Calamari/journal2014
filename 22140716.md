- 13:35 - Just read [Waht makes a bad password ux](http://www.sitepoint.com/good-users-bad-password-ux/). It explaines that passwords a measured as entropy, which means the exponent of 2^n possibilities. (1 single letter has an entropy of 4.7 which means 2^4.7=26).

    But measuring only the entropy isn't always a good way, because hacking programs do word list checks as well, to fasten up.
