- 16:30 - That deploy via rsync capistrano recipe does not remove the .rsync_cache again

- 17:00 - Just found the problem why changing scripts will trigger two rebuilds.

    ```coffeescript
    gulp.task('scripts', ['locales'], function() {
    ```

    will always run locales, which then creates a jsfile, which builds another script file. We want to make sure, not to watch created locales file.

- 20:00 - JS Kata with currying solved. Learned that you can return a function, and give that function a `.valueOf`method, which returns the current primitive value.

    ```js
    add(1)(2) == 3 // true
    add(1)(2)(3) == 6 // true
    ```

- 21:25 - Using `ng-repeat-start` and `ng-repeat-end` we can achieve `li`s that only are appended sometimes, as label for example. [Like in egghead.io tutorial](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-ng-repeat-start).
