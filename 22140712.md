**dancesocially**

- 00:10 - `Coalesce` returns the first null value. So its used to remove null values.

- 10:55 - Text search in PostgreSQL really seems to be enough. Also with [dictionaries](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/textsearch-dictionaries.html) it should be possible to map WCS to West Coast Swing in searches.

- 16:05 - Just read that `.includes` can't be used in polymorphic associations and `.preload` has to be used instead. Maybe that helps in that slow mercury action.

- 16:10 - Aah, and another great idea is, [to add indecies concurrently](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-create-postgres-indexes-concurrently-in) instead of blocking if adding them on bigger tables. It's in there for postgreSQL since Rails 4.

- 16:15 - Just a thought on how to fasten up API calls. Why not simply create a db view which contains that needed data and return it right away, without creting active record models.
