- 17:25 - You cannot get rails to only do one 1 `INSERT` query if you do `Event.create(Array)`. It still does plenty. A faster solution is to wrap with a transaction, so it only commits once to db, but still its many statements. The only thing seems to be [write your own INSERT QUERY](https://www.coffeepowered.net/2009/01/23/mass-inserting-data-in-rails-without-killing-your-performance/).
