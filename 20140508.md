**mindmatters**

- 09:00 - It looks like all our offer calculations are all off...

- 10:30 - After Code Review discussion it seems like noone has an idea. Maybe the removing the uglifier..

- 12:00 - Tried to automatically generate the deps definitions for the requirejs.yml file, but the same error persists

- 13:40 - Now resetting the repo and try to find the breaking commitâ€¦

- 15:10 - Side recherche about gulp. Looks like bundling assets makes more sense using something like browserify. For faster build with browserify using watchify, there is a [recipe](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/fast-browserify-builds-with-watchify.md). *And it works superb.*

    But watchify seems not be able to cope with browserify-shims.

- 15:45 - Finally found out, that rake assets:precompile breaks because of backbone update from 1.0.0 to 1.1.2

    It's the v1.1.1, because they add an UMD wrapper that seems to make problems.

- 17:45 - Found out that the totalDiscount calculation is not correct, but now heading back to dancesocially and gulp.

**home**

- 20:00 - Just refactored distance ordering from geo_address.rb

- 20:50 - I like DHHs term **software writer**. It's about clarity and readability.
