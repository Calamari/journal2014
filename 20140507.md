**mindmatters**

- 09:00 - Notebook powered off in the night again, iTerm does not have feature to just open windows with predefined set of commands. That would be cool.

- 09:20 - Further discussions on github chai and sprockets

- 09:40 - Component.io is kind of cool. What it does is, it allows to write every file using CommonJS syntax, in a build step it will create build/build.js that creates a require.js / Almond.js like shim that defines require() methods and module.exports end points so it can load everything in one file. A bit like browserify.

- 10:00 - Code Review

    Cool stuff:

    - TimeZone.now instead of Time.now, because it always uses the configured time zone

- 11:15 - There is a streaming version of component.io: https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/component-stream

- 11:25 - [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) sounds intersting

- 13:35 - Found [Designer News](https://news.layervault.com/) apparently 2048 was first [published there](http://gabrielecirulli.com/articles/2048-success-and-me)

- 14:00 - While precompile is running, I tried sshing into boot2docker and docker run the containers from their. And they work from there. Now we should think (and maybe blog) about how to pass the request through to the virtual box.

- 15:15 - While still fixing a bug in precompiled code, I found a page with [a Workaround for the port pass through problem](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/doc/WORKAROUNDS.md)

- 17:00 - Gave up for now finding the *Backbone not defined* error in precompiled code and start writing the  offer.js tests with good data and no stubs.

- 18:00 - **It's dancesocially docker time**

    Opening up ssh port forwarding via `boot2docker ssh -L 3333:localhost:3333` works. Linking a postgres db into rails container also seems to work (`--link postgresql:db`).

- 20:00 - First time I can call localhost:3333 and get the right page (without assets). *(While drinking a cappuccino in Galopper des Jahres.)*
