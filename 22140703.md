- 12:10 - Creating ActiveRecord Objects is slow, without creating them we can really gain performance. On Index methods, they are rarely needed, if they are only passed to frontend (serialized to json). A way to not do it is [described here](http://www.manas.com.ar/ary/2012/10/05/avoiding-activerecord-instance-creation-to-boost-performance/):

    ```ruby
    class ActiveRecord::Relation
      def raw
        connection.execute(to_sql)
      end
    end
    ```

    Just open up ActiveRecord relation and return the array of hashes.

- 12:25 - Found [cramp](http://cramp.in/). Faster Rails API thingy. Maybe it could be used together with Rails and share same objects and serializers? So the API has not to berewritten? *(That's for **Dance Socially**)*.

- 14:40 - In reviews the problem should come always first before explaining the solution!!

- 16:00 - Also nice: The [`track` element](http://www.sitepoint.com/comprehensive-look-html5-track-element/?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email) in HTML5.
