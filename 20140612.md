**mindmatters**

- 9:45 - Obviously I had to load the script `http://localhost:7357/testem.js` as well, which makes the websocket connection to the testem server. Now it works.

- 10:10 - The generation of translations has a problem. The original translation thingy will also load translations contained in Gemfiles, mine is not... So I have to copy the relevant translations. *Which is better, because everyone can see what is available.*

- 10:30 - Getting the Error `EMFILE` (to many files), so I have to change the allowed open files from 256 to something more.

    ```
    ulimit -a # gets the limits
    ulimit -n 2560 # sets the limits
    ```

- 15:00 - Mit dem gem [active_model_serializer](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) kann man auch gut serialized objects erstellen. Im gegensatz zu jbuilder, interessant w√§re zu wissen, wie schnell das im Vergleich ist.

- 16:35 - Just learned that primary keys in PostgreSQL are using [sequences](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL).


**webcontrol**

- 20:30 - There is no git? Seriously? And why does it not do anything? Damn it, next time I have to write a readme and a **working** Procfile.


**dancesocially**

- 21:50 - DateTimes again. Argh!! `ends_at` should create a duration, and it works. But saving Date with timezones save the date entered (as it were UTC) and on getting the `starts_at` attribute calculates the timezone on top, that is wrong. The saved value has to subtract the timezone offset.
