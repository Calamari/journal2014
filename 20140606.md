**dancesocially**

- 10:25 - [The timezone gem](https://github.com/panthomakos/timezone) uses geonames.org for getting the timezone of a lat/lng position, which is slow but it uses the [tz database](http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm) for getting the right zone with daylight saving time.

- 13:25 - I have done a simple version with setting `Time.zone` and parsing the starts_at time through `Time.zone.parse` and saving the timezone on event for reference.
