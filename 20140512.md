**mindmatters**

- 10:30 - Just tested gulp-ruby-sass module instead of gulp-sass. For my dance social its just takes a bit more time (0.7ms vs 1.5 ms). I have to try that with the complexity of mercury code.

- 12:30 - Vorbereitung des Reviews:

    Sehr viele Ääähs in meiner Vorbereitung.

**pilot**

- Just meetings…

**home**

- 18:10 - Work on mercury. Got some understanding problems on the exported excel sheet that I have to clarify tomorrow with Toby or Jörg to get the offer tests done.

- 18:40 - Diving into ansible.

    *Noteworthy:*

    - commands don't do piping and shell variables
    - **Keywords:** inventory, patterns, playbooks, commands, facts

- 23:30 - Makefiles get really complicated when trying some variables (reading the version from package.json) and I need some parameter in there as well. Maybe using `Grunt` for this, is more appropriate.

    On another note: I have to figure how best to copy over a docker image from host server to servers. Do I need to setup a docker registry (server) for that or is there a way to directly copy them via scp/ansible?
