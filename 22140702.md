- 18:55 - Trying to figure out, why the heck the table is sooo slow, especially on doing bulk changes.

    It looks like Slickgrid is really fast, but bulk changing 174 offers (only togglig the `planned` attribute) takes 30 or 60 seconds (depending on setting it true or false);

    Updating the filters is taking half the time, the other half is updating the FilteredCollection. To be more specific, updating the filtered collection will redraw monitors on every change (174 times). CRAZY!

- 19:50 - `view.listenTo` in Backbone.js takes care of unbinding event listener. Doing a simple `model.on` would need to unbind on `.remove` of view.

- 20:15 - The `Presenter`-Pattern is also useful in Backbone, see pragmatic link below.

- 20:30 - Maybe a pubsub approach will be useful to get the collection to work together.


**dancesocially**

- 22:00 - What's the best way to prerender some pages into the public directory?

    To use Jekyll, I would have to solve the problem, that it can't use the rails layouts. How to not duplicate them? Somehow using Generators? And how should I compile to versions? One with minified assets and one for development?
