- 16:40 - [node-sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass) does not support globbing in `@import` statements.

- 18:20 - Writing the Makefiles that runs all gulp tasks and then builds docker images.

    Maybe I should be more selective what to `ADD` into the docker container, that takes a bit to much time.

    The reason why production did not have assets (I realize that now) might be that `config.serve_static_assets` is set to `false` on production and there is now nginx in front to serve the assets. I may have to install nginx for that or try make puma serve them as well (or simply set it to `true` for production).

    Oh, and I should write a docker image for nginx

- 23:15 - Just checked the container, it is in deed a config issue. Setting `config.serve_static_assets = true` will make a puma deliver assets from public directory, which totally makes sense.
