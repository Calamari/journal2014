- 15:00 - I just doodled around [codewars](www.codewars.com) for about 2 hours. That was relaxing. I just learned that, I really have to use the `new Array(length)` syntax if creating an array and I know how big it will get. [It's just about 11 times faster](jsperf.com/array-pushy).

    Also I did the kata on adding numbers as Strings. That was really nice practice. x

- 18:00 - Finally got hold of the timezone conversion issues and now it seem to work. Was also a problem with what ActiveRecord is saving on self[:starts_at] and what is behind self.starts_at.

- 23:30 - Just a short kata about flattening arrays.

    I just gamed the system there and learned something: `[1,2,[3,4]].toString()` will return a comma separated list of string representation of all items in that arrays. So it calls itself recursively. It makes the tests green and the kata pass, although the array is altered afterwards (everything is a string).
