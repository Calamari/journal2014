- 12:30 - Just skimmed [an article](http://netengine.com.au/blog/gulp-and-angularjs-a-love-story-or-the-old-wheel-was-terrible-check-out-my-new-wheel/) where they only browserify the own resources and not the dependecies. Which is kind of sensable, because we do not have to rebuild those sources (they should be in a minified state anyway).

- 13:33 - Gulp.watch will break on not defined files, and apparently there is no good solution until gulp 4.0.0. So I will leave this problem as it is for now.

- 14:20 - With splitting up vendor and application JavaScripts that can be a good Blog article or Coderwall Tooltip ("Dont browserify everything" or something like this).

- 14:50 - Damn uglify transform will not create update source maps.

- 19:10 - In Gulp it is really hard to call tasks in given order. Maybe using grunt or make to build files.
