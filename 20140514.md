- 10:15 - Discussions about how to handle database migrations without downtimes.

    Problematic are only migrations with changing columns. There we should be careful, and maybe do the changing of columns step by step. E.g. First add a new column, copy everything from old to new format, and later remove old column, so two different app versions will not have problems with database formats.

    Without those migrations there should be no problem just to use rolling migrations with Phusion Passenger Enterprise or nginx.

    *How to add an extension to a database?*

    Discussion about if this is a "setup" task that should be handled when creating a database (with a template for example) or if it is a migration thing (which it is in my opinion and should work, because adding an extension should be ok by super user and database owner in PostgreSQL.)

- 17:00 - Much done with slickgrid. Problematic seems to be to have a lot of columns, because it either tries to align to browser witdh or columns in header disalign of body (it fixes itself after resizing a column). But writing a simple wrapper method for formatter works really well, and allows to just reuse our formatters.

- 23:30 - Finally (I think) I found the problem why docker does not install on my vserver. The Ubuntu there is only 32 Bit and docker states it needs a 64 Bit OS.
