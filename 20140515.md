- 10:15 - Still working on slick grid. Nothing to reportâ€¦

- 13:10 - [Facebooks OSC](https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=430801045932) wrote a good report on how they change schema on big tables while running it. Basically they make a copy of the table, change it, while a trigger remembers changes on the old table, they apply the changes to the new as well, and rename the new table like the old one and delete the old one.

- 14:30 - Layout nesting in Marionette is a little bit too verbose.

- 17:50 - There is sadly no way of getting slickgrid to allow reorder columns but some columns (e.g. actions column). For this we will have to fork it.

- 22:15 - [Installguide of Docker under xen virtualised server](http://oskarhane.com/install-docker-io-on-a-vps-under-xen/). [Jiffybox](http://www.df.eu/de/cloud-hosting/cloud-server/leistungen/) is done with xen.

- 23:00 - It seems to be state of the art, to have a angular.factory return a (singlton) object, that is shared by many places to have the same data available everywhere. I use this for having the search data available. It is by definition singleton anyway.

- 23:30 - Routing in AngularJS is interesting John Lindquist uses a $routeChangeError handler to handle 404s. Which is quite good solution. If we would call catch on the given resolve promise in routeProvider, the item will still resolve (and the controller load) and would allow to handle the error case because the item is simply `undefined`. Or we use $routeChangeError and parse the current attribute and check what was tried to be loaded and and show something for this.
