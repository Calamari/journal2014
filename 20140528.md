- 9:40 - My new structure for gulp files is now. I create an `assets.json` in root dir, which I load as config file. In it, I define all vendor files, also stuff to copy, the paths and everything else needed by gulp.

- 11:50 - There is a ruby core class, that can load YAML files into `ENV`-Hash. [Described here](http://quickleft.com/blog/simple-rails-app-configuration-settings). Nifty to get several values into environment. Maybe as config.

- 13:50 - [gulp-buster](https://github.com/UltCombo/gulp-buster) does not appear to be able to bust something else then `.js` or `.css` files. What about fonts and images then?

- 21:00 - [socket.io is now 1.0](http://socket.io/blog/introducing-socket-io-1-0/) (since Monday)! Inclusive support for multiple nodes through [socket.io-redis adapter](https://github.com/automattic/socket.io-redis).
Maybe authentication will now be easier to. I would have to redo Boardgames for example.
