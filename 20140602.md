- 09:45 - The `@extend` libsass capabilities are not ready yet and break for more complex stuff. [It is said](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/01/state-of-libsass/) that full compatibility will be there on mid summer.

- 14:30 - Defining 2 rake tasks with the same name result in appending those rake tasks. So if you call that rake task, it will call both.

- 16:45 - Capistrano 2 does checkout the git locally in a cache directory and rsyncs that to server, where it precompiles, and rake migrates everything.
